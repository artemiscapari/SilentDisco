# TODO: create linear model in scipy function.
# A typical model (first variable of lm) has the following form:
# 	response ~ terms
# where response is the (numeric) response vector and terms is a series of terms which specifies a linear predictor for response.  A terms specification of the form first * second

# Response is a vector of values for a channel (in a given time segment).
# Terms is two things: 
# myfit <- lm(dependent_variable ~ channel * time_segment, data = mydata)

# TODO: anova and py-equivalent of etasq for the fitted model.
# Anova(my_fit)
# etasq(my_fit, type = 2)
